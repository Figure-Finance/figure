# Figure

## The new way to _refigure_ your life

_Taking budgeting to a whole new level._

A forward thinking budget app, aiming to provide the user with real tools to improve.

_A user experience like no other_

Other budget apps are often clunky and difficult to use, with a lack of intuitive features. Figure focuses on providing a new kind of user experience - with visual readout and cues to push the user closer to their goals.

Self-identifying areas to improve empowers users to change their habits from within, providing long-term accountability and change.
